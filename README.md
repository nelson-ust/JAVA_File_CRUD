# Development Environment

1. Visual studio Code was the development tool used in developing this App. This is one of my favorites because it is lightweight and flexible. 
2. The Java programming language with oracle jdk15 was used to complete this project. It is very easy to use,  unique language and serves as a multi purpose language. I used the java.util.* alongside the java.io.* Libraries for Java to create and manipulate the file.
3. I used GitHub for version control.
